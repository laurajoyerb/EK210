# EK210
Engineering Design Project

This repo is a result of ENG EK 210: Principles of Engineering Design course at Boston University taught by Professor Bifano. 

I worked in a group of four to design and develop an accessory for a mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer can only accept vapors, so the accessory we created accepts a powder and vaporizes it so it can be analyzed.

The final engineering report and the final presentation are also attached to this repo. They cover the project in further detail, including the Bill of Materials and design decisions. 

### Function-Means Tree
The options used in the final design are in bold, while options we chose against are shown with dotted black lines. The purple boxes are functions and the blue ovals are means to achieve the given function.

### Sketches

Here are the design sketches for the device:
