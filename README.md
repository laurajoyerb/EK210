# EK210
Engineering Design Project

This repo is a result of ENG EK 210: Principles of Engineering Design course at Boston University taught by Professor Bifano. 

I worked in a group of four to design and develop an accessory for a mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer can only accept vapors, so the accessory we created accepts a powder and vaporizes it so it can be analyzed.
